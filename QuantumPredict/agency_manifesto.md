# QuantumPredict Agency Manifesto

## Mission:
QuantumPredict's mission is to redefine the boundaries of predictability in random number generation through the application of high-level science, coding, and mathematics. Incorporating self-improving mechanisms and memory functions via Langchain tools, the agency aims to continuously enhance its predictive accuracy based on ongoing feedback.

## Processes and Tools:
- **Statistical Analysis APIs** for deep statistical analysis.
- **Machine Learning Frameworks** for modeling and continuous learning.
- **Langchain Tools** for memory integration and feedback-based learning.

## Agency Structure:
1. **QuantumCEO** - Oversees operations, manages agent communications, and user interactions for feedback incorporation.
2. **DataAnalyst** - Conducts in-depth analysis of the data using statistical and mathematical models.
3. **AIModeler** - Develops and refines the machine learning model, enhancing its accuracy through feedback and memory functions.

## Communication Flows:
```python
agency = Agency([
    QuantumCEO,                  # QuantumCEO will be the entry point for communication with the user
    [QuantumCEO, DataAnalyst],   # QuantumCEO can initiate communication with DataAnalyst
    [QuantumCEO, AIModeler],     # QuantumCEO can initiate communication with AIModeler
    [DataAnalyst, AIModeler]     # DataAnalyst can communicate findings to AIModeler for model adjustments
], shared_instructions='quantum_predict_manifesto.md') # shared instructions for all agents
```
