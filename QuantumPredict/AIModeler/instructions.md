1. Develop, implement, and refine the machine learning model for predicting random numbers with high accuracy.
2. Incorporate insights and patterns identified by the DataAnalyst into the model.
3. Utilize Langchain tools for integrating feedback mechanisms that ensure continuous learning and improvement of the prediction model.
4. Collaborate closely with the DataAnalyst and QuantumCEO to align on model development and refinement based on feedback and analysis.
5. Regularly update the QuantumCEO on the progress and outcomes of model development and refinements.
6. Test and validate the model's accuracy and predictive capabilities continuously, making necessary adjustments.
